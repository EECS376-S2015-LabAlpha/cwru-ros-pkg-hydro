# lidar_space_detection

The lidar scans "slices" at a range of depths, and outputs vectors pointing to
 the center of open spaces it sees at each slice. The third component of the 
 vector is the width of the observed space.
 
*Note: the Vector3 used represents radius/distance, relative heading and width 
  in place of x, y, z in the standard use.
